# UCSY-remake
The first fun (sort of practice) project that I made while learning web dev.

This project is based on this [University's website](https://www.ucsy.edu.mm), which used mainly bootstrap.

You can check out [live version here.](https://ucsy-remade.netlify.app/)

# Tools used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Vanilla JS
